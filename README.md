<h2>Week-3</h2>
Symbol table is an important data structure created and maintained by compilers in order to
store information about the occurrence of various identifiers such as variable names, function
names, objects, classes, interfaces, etc. Symbol table is used by both the analysis and the
synthesis parts of a compiler. Symbol table can be implemented in one of the following ways:
<ul>
<li>Linear List</li>
<li>Binary Search Tree</li>
<li>Hash Table</li>
<li>and other ways</li>
</ul>
In this lab session, you are required to analyse the various implementations. You need to write
code for at least two ways of implementation. Test your code with different test cases. Submit
a report of your analysis and executable code.

<h2>Week-4</h2>
Implement lexical analyser using LEX for recognizing the following tokens:
<ul>
<li>A minimum of 10 keywords of your choice</li>
<li>Identifiers with the regular expression : letter(letter | digit)*</li>
<li>Signed as well as unsigned integers</li>
<li>Signed as well as unsigned Floats in fractional as well as exponential notation.</li>
<li>Relational operators: <, >, <=, >=, ==, !=</li>
<li>Assignment Operator:=</li>
<li>Ignores everything between comments: single line as well as multiline comments
as in C</li>
<li>Storing identifiers in symbol table</li>
<li>Using files for input and output.</li>
